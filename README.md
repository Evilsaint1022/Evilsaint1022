# <ins>**About me**</ins>
’Im currenty maintaning the [CheekyCharlie](https://github.com/Evilsaint1022/CheekyCharlie) Repo and learning JavaScript by building and maintaining a Discord bot.  
This project helps me understand real-world concepts like event handling, asynchronous code, file-based data storage, and API interactions.

I enjoy improving the bot’s structure, adding new features, and learning best practices along the way.
